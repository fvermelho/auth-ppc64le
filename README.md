#dojot Authentication service


This service handles user authentication for the platform. Namely this is used to
maintain the set of known users, and their associated roles. Should a user need
to interact with the platform, this service is responsible for generating the JWT
token to be used when doing so.

## Installation

This service depends on a couple of python libraries to work. To install them, please run the
commands below. These have been tested on an ubuntu 16.04 environment (same used when generating)
the service's docker image.

```shell
# you may need sudo for those
apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip3 install uwsgi flask requests PyJWT pbkdf2 sqlalchemy py-postgresql flask_sqlalchemy
```

Another alternative is to use docker to run the service. To build the container, from the
repository's  root:

```shell
# you may need sudo on your machine: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/
docker build -t <tag> -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

## configuration
If you are running without docker, You will need to create the database tables
before the first run.

python shell:
```shell
>>> from webRouter import db
>>> db.create_all()
```

## API

The API documentation for this service is written as API blueprints.
To generate a simple web page from it, one may run the commands below.

```shell
npm install -g aglio # you may need sudo for this

# static webpage
aglio -i docs/auth.apib -o docs/auth.html

# serve apis locally

```
